# Number Guessing Game 🎮

Welcome to my first Python project – a simple Number Guessing Gam!
This game allows you to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The program will guide you to guess higher or lower until you find the correct number.

# 🚀 How to Play

1. The game will pick a random number between 1 and 100.
2. You need to enter your guess (an integer between 1 and 100).
3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you get the right number.
5. Once you guess correctly, the game will congratulate you and tell you how many attempts it took.

# 💡 My Experience

This is my first project using Python, and I learned a lot while building it! I started by understanding basic concepts such as loops, conditionals, and random number generation. I’m really excited to see this simple game come to life!

I plan to improve the game in the future by:
- Adding input validation.
- Allowing the user to play multiple rounds.
- Tracking the best score.
- Creating a more advanced version with difficulty levels.
